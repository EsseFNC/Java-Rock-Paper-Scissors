# Java-Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is a simple rock paper scissors game in Java. 

Basically the user inputs a character based on if he wants to chose the rock, the paper or the scissors.
Then the program will generate a random number which will be equal to rock, paper or scissors.
At the end the program will check if the player won/lost or if it's a tie.

I just startet to learn Java and OOP as well, and i just wanted to make some simple projects to get used to the new stuff i'm learning.

Hope you like it. Thank you! :D
